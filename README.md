# Next.js Runtime Environment Configuration

Populate your environment at **runtime** rather than **build time**.

- Isomorphic - Server and browser compatible (and even in middleware.)
- Static site generation support.
- `.env` support during development, just like [Next.js][nextjs-env-vars-order].

### The problem ü§î

[Build once, deploy many][build-once-deploy-many-link] is an essential principle
of software development. The main idea is to use the same bundle for all
environments, from testing to production. This approach enables easy deployment
and testability and is considered a
[fundamental principle of continuous delivery][fundamental-principle-link]. It
is also part of the [twelve-factor methodology][twelve-factor-link]. As crucial
as it is, it has yet to receive significant support in the world of front-end
development, and Next.js is no exception.

Next.js supports [environment variables][nextjs-env-vars], but only at
build time. This means you must rebuild your app for each target environment,
which violates the principle. And it is the most common approach nowadays. But
what if you want, or need, to follow the build once, deploy many principle?

### The solution ü§ì

`next-runtime-env` solves this problem by generating a JavaScript file that is
loaded by the browser and contains the environment variables. We generate this
file at runtime, so you don't have to declare your environment variables at
build time. This approach is also compatible with
[static site generation][static-generation-link], and it works on the server as
well. It also supports middleware, so you can use it to populate your
environment variables in your API routes.

### Getting started üöÄ

1. Add the following lines to your `next.config.js`:

```js
const { configureRuntimeEnv } = require('next-runtime-env/build/configure');

configureRuntimeEnv();
```

When the server starts, this generates an `__ENV.js` file in the `public` folder
containing allow-listed environment variables with a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

2. Add the following to the head section of your `pages/_document.js`:

```tsx
// pages/_document.tsx
<script src="/__ENV.js" />
```

This will load the generated file in the browser.

### Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

In the browser, your variables will now be available at
`window.__ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO` and on the server at
`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO`. For example:

```bash
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO="foo"
BAR="bar"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BAZ="baz"
```

```tsx
// pages/some-page.tsx
type Props = {
  bar: string;
};

export default function SomePage({ bar }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {window.__ENV.NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO} {bar}
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  return {
    props: {
      bar: process.env.BAR,
    },
  };
};
```

### Utilities üõ†

We have included some utility function to make it even easier to work with
environment variables.

#### `env(key: string): string | undefined`

Returns the value of the environment variable with the given key. If the
environment variable is not found, it returns undefined.

##### Example

```tsx
// pages/some-page.tsx
import { env } from 'next-runtime-env';

type Props = {
  bar: string;
};

export default function SomePage({ bar }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {env('NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO')} {bar}
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  return {
    props: {
      bar: env('BAR'),
    },
  };
};
```

#### `allEnv(): NodeJS.ProcessEnv`

Returns all environment variables as a `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` object regardless of
the platform. This is useful if you want to destructure multiple env vars at
once.

##### Example

```tsx
// pages/some-page.tsx
import { allEnv } from 'next-runtime-env';

type Props = {
  bar: string;
};

export default function SomePage({ bar }: Props) {
  const { NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO, NEXT_PUBLIC_BAZ } = allEnv();

  return (
    <div>
      {NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO} {NEXT_PUBLIC_BAZ} {bar}
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const { BAR } = allEnv();

  return {
    props: {
      bar: BAR,
    },
  };
};
```

#### `makeEnvPublic(key: string): void`

Makes the environment variable with the given key public. This is useful if you
want to use an environment variable in the browser, but it was was not declared
with a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

##### Example

```js
// next.config.js
const { configureRuntimeEnv } = require('next-runtime-env/build/configure');
const { makeEnvPublic } = require('next-runtime-env/build/make-env-public');

// Given that `FOO` is declared as a regular env var, not a public one. This
// will make it public and available as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO`.
makeEnvPublic('FOO');

// This will generate the `__ENV.js` file and include `NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO`.
configureRuntimeEnv();
```
